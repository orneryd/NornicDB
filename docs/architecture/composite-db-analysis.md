- ✅ **Vector Indexes**: Merged from all constituents
- ✅ **Range Indexes**: Merged from all constituents
- ✅ **Deduplication**: Duplicate indexes/constraints by name are deduplicated

### 6. Integration Tests
- ✅ End-to-end Cypher query tests
- ✅ Complex queries with WHERE, WITH, aggregation
- ✅ Relationship queries
- ✅ ALTER COMPOSITE DATABASE commands

## 🔍 Implementation Analysis

### Architecture

**Storage Layer:**
- `pkg/storage/composite_engine.go` - Implements `storage.Engine` interface
- Routes operations to constituent engines
- Merges results transparently
- Handles schema merging

**Management Layer:**
- `pkg/multidb/composite.go` - Composite database metadata management
- `pkg/multidb/manager.go` - Integration with DatabaseManager
- `pkg/multidb/routing.go` - Routing strategies (available but not yet integrated)

**Query Layer:**
- `pkg/cypher/composite_commands.go` - Cypher command handlers
- `pkg/cypher/executor.go` - Query routing

### Routing Implementation

**Current State:**
- Basic routing implemented in `CompositeEngine.routeWrite()`
- Uses hash-based routing on labels and properties
- `pkg/multidb/routing.go` provides advanced routing strategies but not yet integrated

**Available but Not Integrated:**
- `LabelRouting` - Route by label to specific constituents
- `PropertyRouting` - Route by property values
- `CompositeRouting` - Combine multiple routing strategies
- `FullScanRouting` - Query all constituents

**Note:** The routing strategies in `pkg/multidb/routing.go` are fully implemented and tested, but `CompositeEngine` currently uses a simpler hash-based approach. Integration would enable user-configurable routing rules.

### Schema Merging

**Fully Implemented:**
- All constraint types merged
- All index types merged (property, composite, fulltext, vector, range)
- Deduplication by name
- Metadata-only merging (indexed data stays in constituents)

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses `GetIndexes()` to get index metadata from constituents
- Recreates indexes in merged schema using `Add*Index()` methods
- Handles type conversion for all index types
- Preserves all index properties (dimensions, similarity function, etc.)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (By Design)

### 1. Remote Constituents Are Supported
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Current Behavior**: Composite databases can include remote constituents addressed by URI, with either forwarded caller auth (`oidc_forwarding`) or explicit service credentials (`user_password`).
- **Execution Model**: Remote constituents participate in routed Fabric execution and explicit remote transaction-handle lifecycles, subject to the same many-read/one-write transaction boundary as local constituents.
- **Design Constraint**: This is still a logical distributed graph topology, not a physically merged graph.

### 2. No Cross-Constituent Relationships
- **Status**: By design
- **Reason**: Relationships require both nodes in same database
- **Workaround**: Use composite queries to find related nodes

### 3. No Distributed Transactions
- **Status**: By design
- **Reason**: Multi-constituent writes are best-effort
- **Future**: Two-phase commit could be added

### 4. Simple Hash-Based Routing
- **Status**: Functional but basic
- **Reason**: Advanced routing strategies exist but not integrated
- **Future**: Integrate `pkg/multidb/routing.go` strategies

### 5. Index Data Not Merged
- **Status**: By design
- **Reason**: Indexes have internal state (values maps)
- **Note**: Schema metadata is merged, actual indexed data stays in constituents
- **Impact**: SHOW INDEXES works, but query optimization uses constituent indexes

## 🎯 Potential Enhancements (Future)

### 1. Advanced Routing Integration
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Description**: Integrate `pkg/multidb/routing.go` strategies into `CompositeEngine`
- **Benefit**: User-configurable routing rules

### 2. Query Optimization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: 5-7 days
- **Description**: AST-based query analysis to skip unnecessary constituents
- **Benefit**: Better performance for targeted queries

### 3. Parallel Query Execution
- **Priority**: Low (already parallel at engine level)
- **Effort**: 1-2 days
- **Description**: Explicit parallel execution with goroutines
- **Benefit**: Better control over concurrency

### 4. Remote Constituents
- **Priority**: Low
- **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Description**: Support databases in other NornicDB instances
- **Benefit**: True distributed databases

### 5. Distributed Transactions
- **Priority**: Low
- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Description**: Two-phase commit for multi-constituent writes
- **Benefit**: ACID guarantees across constituents

## Conclusion

The composite database implementation is complete.

All features from the original requirements have been implemented:
- ✅ ALTER COMPOSITE DATABASE commands
- ✅ Query result deduplication
- ✅ Integration tests
- ✅ Complete schema merging (all index types)
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Edge case handling

The only "missing" features are future enhancements (remote constituents, distributed transactions) which are documented as limitations and planned for future releases.

**No critical gaps or incomplete implementations remain.**
